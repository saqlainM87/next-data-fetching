# Next.js v12.1 Data Fetching Boilerplate

In this repo you will find all the data fetching methods like:
Server side rendering, static site generation, incremental static regeneration (also on demand) and basic react client-side rendering.

The fetching methods are getServerSideProps, getStaticProps. The old method was getInitialProps.

In another video, we will talk about what getStaticPaths does.
